# Crypto Arbitrage

This is a python script that analyzes aritrage opportunities between Bitcoin prices on Bitstamp and Coinbase exchanges. The script works by taking in a `bitstamp.csv` and 'coinbase.csv'. It then clean and slices the data to analyze three separate days throughout the quarter to identify and calculate aritrage opportunities.
